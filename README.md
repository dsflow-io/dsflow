## What is dsflow?

We're pleased to introduce _dsflow_ ‚Äî the **framework for data science**.

_Dsflow_ helps you build powerful and flexible **pipelines for data analytics**.
The current version is designed for use on your local computer, using the **command line interface**.
Eventually you'll be able to use dsflow to deploy your pipelines to cloud platforms.

## TL;DR;

- install or update Docker üê≥ (`brew cask install docker`)
- clone this git repo
- execute `source init.sh` to initialize the dsflow environment and build docker images (_it might take over 10 minutes to download all sources_ ‚òïÔ∏è)
- execute `dsflow` to see the list of dsflow commands
- execute `dsflow generate-job`: display the list of job templates
- execute `dsflow generate-job TEMPLATE_NAME JOB_NAME`: generate a job based on a template
- execute `dsflow run JOB_NAME`: runs the job in its associated container
- execute `dsflow start-jupyter` to open the default IDE in your browser (Jupyter Lab with pyspark) at http://localhost:8888/
- execute `dsflow stop-all` to terminate all dsflow Docker containers.

See documentation below for detailed instructions.


## Tech stack 360

Those are the defaults when adopting dsflow:

- Run everything within containers  (using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)).
- Query and transform data with [Apache Spark 2.2](https://spark.apache.org/).
- Store data as [Parquet files](https://parquet.apache.org/).
- Write code and iterate on your scripts using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).
- Orchestrate your jobs and pipelines with [Apache Airflow (incubating)](https://airflow.apache.org/) ‚Äì _not implemented yet_.
- Build powerful dashboards with [Plotly Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/).
- Collaborate with your team using Github (or any [version control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)).


## Core principles

**Note**: if you're not familiar with the following principles,  
dsflow CLI and dsflow Job Templates will help you adopt them.

- a) Pipelines are made of jobs
- b) Separation of compute and storage
- c) Containerization
- d) Daily partitions of data


### a) A pipeline is a chain of jobs

The concept of _pipeline_ in dsflow inherits from the concept of _DAG_ in Airflow.  A _Directed Acyclic Graph_ is a collection of all the jobs you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their relationships and dependencies.

A data pipeline is also called a _workflow_.

**Note ‚ö†Ô∏è**: dsflow v-0.3.1 DOES NOT provide the assistant for generation of pipelines. Yet, you can create your pipelines using Airflow. DIY.


#### Typical dsflow pipeline

![example dsflow pipeline](docs/src/example_dsflow_pipeline.png)


#### Zoom on jobs: inputs and outputs

_Jobs_ are single units of data transformation. They take one or multiple **inputs** and produce an **output**. Most of the work of Data Scientists consists in creating jobs, and improving them constantly, through successive iterations.

Notebook environments are well suited for data exploration and experimentation. Then it's natural to turn a notebook into a job. With dsflow, you'll be able to parametrize your notebooks by specifying input and output values. Notebooks become **first-class** jobs.

### b) Separation of compute and storage

Unlike traditional databases, dsflow relies on the principle of separation of compute and storage.

When you run dsflow on your computer, your resources -- **data**, jobs, notebooks, docker files -- are stored in distinct directories. It's organized in a way that simplifies future deployment of your pipelines to the cloud.

**Data** is stored in a directory called `datastore/`:

- as such you could use any Big Data compute engine (Spark, Hive, Presto, etc.) to query it.
- this `datastore/` directory can be local or distant
- \[future release\]: dsflow will help you download samples of your production datastore, so that it gets easier to iterate locally on smaller datasets.
- \[future release\]: dsflow will help manage multiple datastores, in order to provide access control and better resources management.

**Scripts** are stored in a directory called `jobs/`:

- they are distinct from the data they process.
- all jobs MUST take **input** and **output** parameters (or **source** / **sink** parameters), because the logic has to be independent from what it processes.  
For instance, a given job should be able to process either local data or distant data.


### c) Containerization

Running your jobs within Docker containers bring many advantages:

- **No more library conflicts**  
Big data tools and ML libraries keep evolving. Being able to run each script in an isolated environment is critical in order to avoid conflicts, and run both legacy script and cutting edge logic.
- **Easily adopt newest Data Science tools**  
New tools and libraries running in containers won't break legacy software.
- **Portability**  
Execute a script on your laptop or in the cloud seamlessly. Stay independent from your cloud provider.
- **Scalability**  
Each task (instance of a job) runs in its own container. It allows a better allocation of resources: running tasks in parallel, using a memory configuration optimized for each task.


### d) Daily partitions of data

_\[important: this section is merely about conventions\]_

The acronym `ds` not only stands for Data Science, it's also the default name for date partitions following ISO format (e.g. `my_table/ds=2017-11-27/`).

If you store your data with daily `ds` partitions, the meaning of it will depend on whether you deal with dimensions tables (`dim`) or fact tables (`fct`).

#### In case of a "dimension" table:

Each `ds` partition shall contain a whole snapshot of the table.
For instance, `users/ds=2017-11-27/` will contain a **dump** of the `users` table made on 11/27/2017.

It brings the following benefits:

- daily versioning of your data
- keeping daily snapshots of a dataset makes it easier to compute KPIs and monitor the evolution of the metrics
- you avoid overwriting data, instead you append by creating a new partition.
- you can safely delete older snapshots of your tables once there are no longer needed.

Note: as a convention, such a table is prefixed with `dim_`

#### In case of a "fact" table:

Each `ds` partition shall contain the facts of that day.  
For instance, `transactions/ds=2017-11-27/` will contain the events the transactions logged on 11/27/2017.

- it's a standard way to store large datasets
- it makes it easier to optimize queries of large datasets, by selecting the `ds` range that matters

Note: as a convention, such a table is prefixed with `fct_`


#### Meaning of `ds` partitions with dsflow:

By default, dsflow jobs will take a single `ds` partition as input, and output to the same `ds` partition of a target table.

#### Weekly partitions? Hourly partitions?

Daily `ds` partitions are the default setting of dsflow Job Templates. We follow the conventions of Airflow. See for instance the [HivePartitionSensor](https://airflow.apache.org/code.html?highlight=%20ds#airflow.operators.HivePartitionSensor).

Monthly, weekly, or hourly partitions are also possible.




## Documentation

### Requirements

Brew and Python need to be installed on your system.
If not, execute in your terminal:

```
xcode-select --install
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install python
```

A recent version of Docker is needed:

```
brew cask install docker
```

Installation on Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/


**Frequent issues when installing dsflow on macOS**

- xcode: If your it is outdated, update it with the app store, or just move it to Trash.
- Python: dsflow CLI works with Python 2.7 and 3.3+ and only requires the `pyyaml` module in addition to core modules. Scripts with additional requirements will run in containers.
- Docker: make sure it's running before launching dsflow.
- Docker-compose: make sure it's up-to-date (dsflow requires support for version '3.3')




### Initialize dsflow

Inside the dsflow project directory:

```
source init.sh

```

**In depth:**

This will set up environment variables and provide a shortcut to dsflow commands.  
For instance, `dsflow tree` will execute `python dsflow/dsflow-tree.py`


### Show list of available commands

```
dsflow
```


### Quickly download and explore dataset

run `dsflow generate-adhoc NOTEBOOK_NAME DATASET_URL csv|json`: dsflow will generate a notebook `NOTEBOOK_NAME` and will help you explore a csv or json dataset.


JSON files:

```
dsflow generate-adhoc meteo_paris "https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/prevision-meteo-paris-arome@paris-saclay/download/?format=json&timezone=Europe/Berlin" json
```

CSV files:

```
dsflow generate-adhoc meteo_france "https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/donnees-synop-agregees-journalier@api-agro/download/?format=csv&timezone=Europe/Berlin&use_labels_for_header=true" csv
```

Notes:

- make sure URL is quoted with \"



### Execute a notebook:

```
dsflow run JOB_NAME PARAMETERS
dsflow run meteo-json-dump 2017-11-09
dsflow run meteo-create-table 2017-11-09

```

### Launch notebook environment:

```
dsflow start-notebook

```


### Generate table from CSV

```
dsflow generate-job create_table_from_csv TABLE_NAME

```

## Current limitations / known issues

- python scripts --> bash scripts
- only the `ds` partition is available
- dsflow.load_tables() : we should specify if a table is "fct" or "dim"


## Beta testers

We put together a pool of beta testers.
